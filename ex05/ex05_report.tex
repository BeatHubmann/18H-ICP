\section{Introduction}

To measure the fractal dimension of the percolating cluster in a square site lattice, both the Sandbox Algorithm and the Box Counting algorithm as described in~\cite{herrmann} were implemented. The largerst cluster found by the Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm~\cite{hoshen} was used as percolating cluster.

\section{Algorithm Description}
The Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm implementation was taken over from the previously submitted exercise 03.\\
Both the Sandbox and the Box Counting algorithm were implemented as described in the course lecture notes~\cite{herrmann}.\\
For the box counting method, the choice was made to double the cell size at each step until reaching the lattice size $L$, i.e. $\epsilon \in \{1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, L\}$.

\section{Results}


The program was implemented as described above and submitted with this report. 
A square site lattice of side length $L=1024$ and occupation probabilities $p \in \{0.58, p_c=0.592746, 0.61\}$ were used.
As in the previous exercise, \texttt{C++}'s Mersenne Twister \texttt{mt19937} was used to initialize the lattices.

\subsection{Experiment 1: Sandbox Algorithm}
The box masses $M(R)$ where $M$ equals the numbers of sites occcupied by the largest (i.e. percolating) cluster at occupation probability $p$ in a box of increasing side length $R$ on a site lattice with side length $L=1024$, were recorded for $R \in \{3, 4, \cdots, L\}$. The results were plotted as $\log(M(R))$ versus $\log(R)$ as shown in figure~\ref{fig:1}.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Experiment 2: Box Counting Algorithm}
The number of non-empty grid cells $N(\epsilon)$ where $\epsilon$ is the grid constant were recorded for $L=1024$ and $\epsilon \in \{1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, L\}$ as described above. The results were plotted as $\log(N(\epsilon))$ versus $\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ as shown in figure~\ref{fig:2}.

\section{Discussion}
The slope of 1.88 of the line for $p=p_c$ in figure~\ref{fig:1} obtained from the Sandbox algorithm is well in line with the theoretical value of $d_f=\frac{91}{48} \approx 1.89$ for a 2D lattice and thus as expected.
For some reason reason, \texttt{gnuplot} couldn't be brought to fit a slope to the line for $p=p_c$ in figure~\ref{fig:2} obtained from the Box Counting algorithm. However, a visual inspection reveals that the slope is just a tad under 2 and thus in line with both the sandbox algorithm results and theoretical expectations.
